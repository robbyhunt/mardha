## Hexslinger Backfire Table

1–4 - Brain Drain: The Manitous fries part of the hexslinger mind with energy. He’s Shaken for 1d6 rounds before he can attempt to recover, and his Gambling drops a die type for 24 hours.

5–8 - Backlash: The Manitous overloads the hexslinger's nervous system with eldritch energy. He suffers 3d6 damage.

9–12 - Spirit Sap: The hexslinger must make a Vigor roll or become Incapacitated. Even with success he suffers a level of Fatigue. One level of Fatigue is recovered every 15 minutes of rest.

13–15 - Madness: The Manitous drives the hexslinger insane. He picks up a Dementia from the Dementia Table. He must also make a Smarts roll. If failed, the Dementia is permanent. Otherwise it lasts for 1d6 days before he “snaps out of it.”

16–19 - Corruption: The power is twisted to have the worst possible result for the hexslinger. Damage-causing spells affect him or his allies, protection affects his foes, information-gathering incantations lie, and so on.

20 - Mindwipe: The Manitous fries a part of the hexslinger mind. Their Gambling die drops 1 level permanently.

## Dementia Table

1–2 - Absent Minded: The character tends to forget little details. He might eat raw coffee one day or forget to wear his pants the next. To remember an important detail, he must make a Smarts roll. If he fails, he can’t remember it. Don’t overuse this, Marshal, just when it is important.

3–4 - Delusion: The inventor’s mind snaps and he comes to believe something that is patently untrue. Maybe he thinks he’s a werewolf, or the sky is blue because the “Moon People” paint it that way every morning. This quirk reduces his Charisma by 1.

5–6 - Eccentricity: This cowpoke becomes what we like to call an eccentric. Other folks just call him “loco.” Maybe he smothers his food in vinegar or eats lots of bran to keep his digestive system clear (ugh). The condition is basically harmless and amusing, though occasionally annoying, lowering his Charisma by 1.

7–8 - Evil Deeds: An insidious manitou convinces the hero that someone or something is evil, and must be stopped. Each time the character gets this result, his madness is more pronounced. At first he may only talk badly about his “enemies.” Later on he might attempt to ruin or even kill them.

9–10 - Depression: The tortured genius becomes incredibly depressed about himself, his inventions, the futility of humanity, or his chances of surviving another adventure. He often speaks of mankind’s impending doom. His lack of faith causes him to lose 1 point of Grit every time he gets this result.

11–14 - Phobia: The scientist develops a strange fear of something completely irrational and unrelated to his inventions (his phobia does not prevent him from working). He gains a Major Phobia when in the presence of the feared object or environment. See Savage Worlds for a complete description of phobias and their effects.

15–16 - Mumbler: The engineer talks to himself constantly and his sentences often taper off into meaningless drivel. Occasionally, he might hear “voices” talking back, whispering the secrets to brilliant new inventions. The frightening truth is, the voices are real. This lowers his Charisma by 1.

17–18 - Paranoia: Everyone’s out to steal the inventor’s ideas, or so he believes. Or maybe sinister creatures from “Dimension X” are lurking just outside his lab, waiting to steal his amazing breakthrough so they can conquer the Earth. His bizarre claims lower his Charisma by 2.

19–20 - Schizophrenia: Any time any player draws a Joker, the character adopts a drastically different attitude. At one moment he might be passive and restrained. Later on he’s a raving madman. Choose a new Minor Hindrance for the poor sap to reflect the change. Make sure the Hindrance is a mental instability rather than a physical handicap.
