# The Barony of Ashlan

A small Barony with dense grass and underbrush covering the rolling hills underfoot. Patches of wood dot the landscape and the thicker uncivilised woodlands to the north and west make travel further inland a struggle.

The barony was founded by famous singer, poet, and playwright Brynstan Ashrider. When a political song the baron had been comissioned to write helped quell a burgeoning rebellion, he was personally awarded ownership of a small, disheveled, and mostly out of use trade checkpoint along the shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars by King Joceus of Arenda.

Though not much more than a market platform and a handful of log cabins at the time, word of Lord Ashrider's hands-off rule quickly traveled and settlers flocked to new beginings. The inexperienced Lord is quickly turning the humble Barony into a young political power to be watched by the other leaders of Arenda.

The site of the original trading checkpoint which the barony was founded on is unrecognisable now that the bustling port town of Bryn stands proudly in it's place. A common resting place for traders traveling accross the inland Sea of Fallen Stars, and a low-cost - albeit dangerous - entry into the great kingdom of Arenda. Home to the Baron of Ashlan, Brynstan Ashrider.

## Twisted Spire

Deep in the dense woodlands of the barony, nestled in a long overgrown grove, an ancient spire with a twisting structure pierces through the treeline. It is said in rumor that the spire contains the treasures of an ancient being known as "The Immortal Keeper", as well as the Keeper's ashes, thought to hold within them the key to unnatural life.

Though all that have sought it's treasures have failed to return, most believe they simply never made it to the spire at all. Opting instead to believe that they simply fell victim to one of the uncivilised wood's many dangers.
