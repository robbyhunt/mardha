A highly controversial but highly profitable enchanted goods supplier. Often regarded as one of the primary enablers of Scribing finding it's foothold in the criminal world. Six out of every ten solved Arcum-related murders in Arteris were found to have been commited with an Allidar's wand.

___

<div class="script">Black Wolf Mercenary Company</div>

A well-known mercenary company, whose skill in combat is extremely highly regarded. The balance of many battles have been swayed by the involvment of the Black Wolves, and their retainment is highly sought after by Barons, Lords, Queens, and Princes. The Black Wolves are loyal to the highest bidder, and they maintain notoriety for their neutrality - once switching sides four times between battles during the Skirmishes of Stet.

### The Order
___

<div class="script">The Order</div>

A knightly order of Wakana attuned warriors and mystics, who seek to protect and serve the people of Mardha, while reaching hightened enlightenment. Members are called "Guardians". They are known of throughout most of Lorien and Avestan, and are most recognisable by their translucent glowing blades of Wakana.

#### The Balance

Guardians of The Order believe [The Balance](/magic/#the-balance) should be maintained. They are extremely mindful of the effect the use of their powers has on The Balance, and so refrain from doing so, unless their oath compels them to.

In the teachings of The Order, death itself is also part of The Balance. Though feats of healing and revivification are theoretically possible through manipulation of Wakana, The Order forbids studies of the kind.

#### Energy Blades

All Guardians of The Order who reach the rank of Apprentice recieve the ["Wakana Weapon"](/almanac/edgehindrancepower.html#wakana-weapon) edge for free, but must take an oath, gaining the Vow (Major) hindrance.

#### The Oath

All Guardians must take an oath when they are taken up by a master as apprentice.

- Defend and protect, never attack.
- Improve one's self through knowledge and training.
- Maintain The Balance, only alter it when necessary.
- Respect all life, in any form.
- Serve others, for the good of Mardha.
