# Welcome to Mardha

Aumyr is a fantasy setting for role-playing games, born with the aim of being free, adaptable and ready to be played. It can accommodate many types of systems (d20™, Dungeons & Dragons®, Pathfinder®, Labyrinth Lord, etc...), provided they contain magic and wizards, elves, dragons, dwarves, warriors and so on. For a campaign set on Aumyr, use the basic manuals for your favorite role-playing game. No value is provided typical of some systems such as Armor Class, Skill, Salvation Shooting, CD or other features, so that it is entirely entrusted to the Master the ability to conduct the session independently.

## The world is yours

In these pages you will find only some information about world history, deities and geography: it will be up to you to give life and color to everything else. Aumyr is designed to be used both by Masters who like to schedule their own game sessions, and for those who like to improvise and let themselves be guided by roleplay. In the first case you will have several details on the setting, in the second it will be enough for the Master to take what he wants to start playing.

## Where to start

This book includes adventure tips in each paragraph: you can play a simple adventure, a Campaign or set your own game sessions from a different era. Feel free to use the material in this manual as you see fit: you can just take cues, follow the descriptions precisely or rewrite the entire history of the world.

### Adventures and Campaigns

The quickest way to start playing with this setting is to choose a Region. Each territory of the continent offers a range of ready made options, such as the description of the Capital, the Famous Places and so on. All you have to do is choose where to start your game sessions. Some ideas for Adventures and Campaigns are included in Almanac.

### Different Eras

As you'll find out later, the history of the world spans the ages. This book describes places, events and gods based on the assumption that the year used for your campaign is 2372 EC, but nothing prevents you from choosing another period from the chronology or defining your own version of world history. You will find many ideas in the History section and Geography.

## Tone and Narration

Aumyr is a place full of stories, tales, events, legends and heroes. As every world has some distinctive characters, which help to make everything more interesting and consistent. Here are some points to keep in mind when playing a fantasy role-playing campaign on Aumyr:

### The Past is Legend

Aumyr has a long and detailed history, too long to be comprehensively included in a few lines. Very little is known about the world "before the Five". Some tangible evidence of these ancient legends, such as ruins, dungeons and caves, comes from the past or is discovered by adventurers, often in unusual places. Most of these objects and places are mostly historical curiosities: you may find statuettes of creatures never seen before, stone boards or parchments with unknown characters. Other discoveries may include dangerous magical objects, powerful relics, powerful hidden places, or ancient destructive creatures.

### Undefined morality

The passing of centuries and the tendency of the population to try to survive with their own forces in a hostile world, has produced a society where often there is no clear border between what is right and what is wrong, between "good" and "evil". Apart from the laws of the Brotherhood that establish a general order of things, everyone tries to live by seeking the best for himself. For example, we could find a village tavernerns, which to round up the collection smuggling rare or illegal potions, magicians who defend their territory using dangerous spells, necromancers who pillage and infest forgotten tombs, villages under siege of some group of hungry creatures, and much more.

### Knowledge is Power

Possessing information means knowing part of the destiny of the world. All information is power. Forcing a king to abdicate, possessing evidence of his own demonic pact that would discredit him in the eyes of the people, is just one example of this power. The knowledge of precious information, ancient knowledge, lost places and ancient legends is a precious commodity and is often used as a real currency of exchange between adventurers.

### Endless Possibilities

It is a basically meritocratic world where often gambling or intuition are evidence of genius and change. A clever magician with strong diplomatic skills could convince a sovereign to hire him as a court sorcerer, opening up new possibilities and access to new funds for his arcane discoveries, and so on.

### Magic and Mystery

Aumyr is populated by both numerous and powerful adventurers and ordinary people. Many do not reach old age, having to face dangers and exploits beyond imagination: most adventurers die, and it is a reality very clearly understood. Adventurers are seen both as heroes and as wicked and completely unaware of the danger of the world. Most people prefer to deal with everyday problems, rather than embark on reckless adventures where they could lose their lives, or worse.
