the people/place which worship filuum vallos are mostly against those who manipulate Wakana. They see it as robbing Vallos of his will. Fate is in the hand of vallos, no others. - This raises the question of whether my wildcards are free from fate thing exists, and whether it actually exists in the sense that fillum does exist and does influence peoples "fate" but wildcards are immune to this for whatever reason. and then does being a wakana manipulator automatically make you a wild card? like people who aren't free from fate can't do manipulate it?



kingdom across the bay from varilia is a roman based centurian fighter guys kingdom but more medieval style. check picture in images of centurian knight



Brass is a satus symbol in this world because it typically indicates synium machinary, which is typically only available to the rich and powerful. It has started to be used in other ways (monocles etc.) simply because of the associations with status and wealth. City of Brass could be a cool nickname for arteris, or some other big rich city.

some place where there's a giant crevice in the ground and one famous bridge is the only way to cross. maybe it's owned by a particular faction and it's use is important? idk about that... Also maybe think about the cause of the giant crevice and what it looks like (singed, smooth, etc. depends why it's there. Maybe nobody knows.)

a culture/race where they all have their social rank at the start of their names. So like "Khal Tornin" where Khal means warrior, smith, wanderer etc.



think about wtf to do with elves. do i wanna keep the current mirvale + divinity elves or go back to the wild elf idea + add the jew elves as the opposite. or maybe as a subversion maybe the divinity elves were the ones who evolved into the jew elves! this explains their canibalism etc. oh ye that's the one. Wild elves + jew elves from ravenhound but change valen word to something else. wonder if I can use the name for something else though.

the jew elves opperate like the rl world elite in that they are large families (noble style) with tons of money and power

  - kingdom/country names: Ostra, Bergia, Minassia, Avestan,
  - lady landra/landria
  - air ships/sky pirates (al-bhed) (jess pirate princess)
  - kingslist (think of where to use this idea - tribal style or big kingdom style or omething else)
  - cazio montila, the sorceror king of minassia, and minassia itself (or come up with a better name)
  - grim barrows idea of a revival leadership (doesn't have to be a necropolis though, could be a naturey environment or a magicy one.) maybe I can tie this in with the jew elves OR with the aehterborn
