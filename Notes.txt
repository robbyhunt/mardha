Wakana Jedis - organisation + edges
 - started by a runt monk from one of the beastfolk races who wasn't strong enough to use his fists, so he developed a technique to create a blade of energy by manipulating Wakana.
 - samurai thing where they don't start their energy blade unless they intend to draw blood. to offset the manipulation of Wakana.

god called ulene



the people/place which worship filuum vallos are mostly against those who manipulate Wakana. They see it as robbing Vallos of his will. Fate is in the hand of vallos, no others. - This raises the question of whether my wildcards are free from fate thing exists, and whether it actually exists in the sense that fillum does exist and does influence peoples "fate" but wildcards are immune to this for whatever reason. and then does being a wakana manipulator automatically make you a wild card? like people who aren't free from fate can't do manipulate it?



Brass is a satus symbol in this world because it typically indicates synium machinary, which is typically only available to the rich and powerful. It has started to be used in other ways (monocles etc.) simply because of the associations with status and wealth. City of Brass could be a cool nickname for arteris, or some other big rich city.



city called Argon (aedan black solo game)



a word/phrase for an individual who's fate is unwritten - ie a WILD CARD. kinda like divinity 1 where you're not in the script kinda thing



dunno about these yet:
 - setting rule where bennies are given at milestones rather than per session
 - setting rule for "breathers" where once per milestone the players can take an hour rest to make natural healing rolls and all get one benny (still max 3)

a sunken ancient library/archive in a swampy region which has been enhabited by a creature/creatures which are unable to utilise it's knowledge (maybe undead/lich, maybe lizardfolk/that kinda thing, maybe another person who was cursed inside of the place and now guards it (maybe that's why it was abandoned/sunken in the first place))



a culture/race where they all have their social rank at the start of their names. So like "Khal Tornin" where Khal means warrior, smith, wanderer etc.



think about wtf to do with elves. do i wanna keep the current mirvale + divinity elves or go back to the wild elf idea + add the jew elves as the opposite. or maybe as a subversion maybe the divinity elves were the ones who evolved into the jew elves! this explains their canibalism etc. oh ye that's the one. Wild elves + jew elves from ravenhound but change valen word to something else. wonder if I can use the name for something else though.

the jew elves opperate like the rl world elite in that they are large families (noble style) with tons of money and power



figure out deity situation. Do i wanna bring in filuum vallos and cascum maluum etc. and if so how does that work. are they actually gods or is it just a belief etc etc.



make room for humanoid non human races. like chiss style etc. look at various examples in inspiration images



fight arena where the fighters/gladiators are criminals awaiting trial. many of the fighters are falslely accused of crimes and forced into the arena because of their fighting abilities. If the fighters do well they make everyone a ton of money and will never see a trial. If they do poorly they will likely die in battle or in chains



bandit kingdom



Stuff to add from notes:
  - thousand lakes region + twin peaks capital
  - good city/town names
  - queen who can't be looked at. all servants and councilers and so and such wear elaborate eye-covering masks or perhaps haave their eyes removed. Possibly a monk/temple type vibe - or hyper regal noble style
  - kingdom/country names: Ostra, Bergia, Minassia, Avestan,
  - lady landra/landria
  - air ships/sky pirates (al-bhed) (jess pirate princess)
  - kingslist (think of where to use this idea - tribal style or big kingdom style or omething else)
  - cazio montila, the sorceror king of minassia, and minassia itself (or come up with a better name)
  - grim barrows idea of a revival leadership (doesn't have to be a necropolis though, could be a naturey environment or a magicy one.) maybe I can tie this in with the jew elves OR with the aehterborn 
  - first world (first draft of the world)
  - fleshout ironlands
  - the stag king (image)
  - death god or somethin (image)
