Wakana Jedis - organisation + edges
 - started by a runt monk from one of the beastfolk races who wasn't strong enough to use his fists, so he developed a technique to create a blade of energy by manipulating Wakana.
 - samurai thing where they don't start their energy blade unless they intend to draw blood. to offset the manipulation of Wakana.



recharge rules for all magics - arcum as a resource regens auto, syn doesn't
something about scribers scrolls losing their enchantments and returning to the crystals which recharge
getting more power points as a scribe relates to an increase in efficiency of scribing



dunno about these yet:
 - setting rule where bennies are given at milestones rather than per session
 - setting rule for "breathers" where once per milestone the players can take an hour rest to make natural healing rolls and all get one benny (still max 3)



think about wtf to do with elves. do i wanna keep the current mirvale + divinity elves or go back to the wild elf idea + add the jew elves as the opposite. or maybe as a subversion maybe the divinity elves were the ones who evolved into the jew elves! this explains their canibalism etc. oh ye that's the one. Wild elves + jew elves from ravenhound but change valen word to something else. wonder if I can use the name for something else though.

the jew elves opperate like the rl world elite in that they are large families (noble style) with tons of money and power



figure out deity situation. Do i wanna bring in filuum vallos and cascum maluum etc. and if so how does that work. are they actually gods or is it just a belief etc etc.



make room for humanoid non human races. like chiss style etc. look at various examples in inspiration images



Stuff to add from notes:
  - thousand lakes region + twin peaks capital
  - good city/town names
  - queen who can't be looked at. all servants and councilers and so and such wear elaborate eye-covering masks or perhaps haave their eyes removed. Possibly a monk/temple type vibe - or hyper regal noble style
  - kingdom/country names: Ostra, Bergia, Minassia, Avestan,
  - lady landra/landria
  - air ships/sky pirates (al-bhed) (jess pirate princess)
  - kingslist (think of where to use this idea - tribal style or big kingdom style or omething else)
  - cazio montila, the sorceror king of minassia, and minassia itself (or come up with a better name)
  - grim barrows idea of a revival leadership (doesn't have to be a necropolis though, could be a naturey environment or a magicy one.) maybe I can tie this in with the jew elves OR with the aehterborn 
  - first world (first draft of the world)
  - fleshout ironlands
  - the stag king (image)
  - death god or somethin (image)
  - a secret people based on the kynan solo game where some vengeful king swore death on all of some certain kind of people and one smal town/village managed to escape the wrath. they setup somewhere secret and have been keeping to themselves for generations. they were known to have had (still have) some great skill or talent (maybz taming untamable beasts (yakul) or some item prodution speciality)
  - a hilly/sparsely mountainous region where the peaks float like pillars (image new homeland in inspiration folder)
  - griffon riding special forces for some kingdom/government or whatever
  - look in the inspiration images folder in general because there's loads of great ideas in there
